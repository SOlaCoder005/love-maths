#### Testing that your JS file is linked up to HTML
- Use [console.log.("[some text]");] in the JS file
- Run GC Dev Tools and click Console tab, your [some text] message should be printed in the console.


#### **Single Responsibility Principle:** 
- Suggested that each funtion should have one key role only. 
- This approach avoids creating too many variables in the 'global scope'.
- **Remeber:** Your script may not be the only script loading on the page. Variables that work on a global scope c an contibute to site issues. 
- To do this, make sure everything is contained within a fucntion block of code. For more info, see [here](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/courses/course-v1:CodeInstitute+LM101+2021_T1/courseware/2d651bf3f23e48aeb9b9218871912b2e/78f3c10a937c4fe09640c7c0098d16bd/?child=first).


#### **Doc Strings:**
- Used in JS file to tell coders what a specific function does. 
- Syntax:  **_[/** */]_**
-  Will appear when you hover over any **duplicate** function on the JS file. #

1. functions section
2. event handler section
